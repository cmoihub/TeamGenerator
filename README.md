# TeamGenerator
This program will be used to arrange members of the department
    into sub-units equally (for now) and randomly
    For example,
    Given A, B, C, D, E, F,G
    If you want to have 2 teams based on this you would get [A, B, C] & [D, E, F, G]
    in one scenario and [A, D, F] and [B, C, E, G]
    3 teams e.g. [A, B], [C, D], [E, F, G]
